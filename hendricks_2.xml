    <title>Chicken Fried Rice</title>
<ingreds>
<i n="1">Brown rice – leftover rice from the day before works best. White rice will work great here too.</i>
<i n="2">Chicken breasts – I like to dice the chicken into very small pieces about <measurement>1/2 – 3/4-inch</measurement>, it makes it the perfect size for this fried rice.</i>
<i n="3">Toasted sesame oil – this oil is very strong and a little goes a long way. This ingredient adds lots of flavor to this dish.</i>
<i n="4">Vegetable oil (or canola oil) – this is used for sautéing (along with the sesame oil so you won’t use to much of that and sesame oil on it’s own has a low smoke point).</i>
<i n="5">Frozen peas and carrots blend – I like to use the frozen vegetable here to save time, but fresh will work too you’ll just have to  longer so they’ll become tender enough.</i>
<i n="6">Green onions – feel free to add more green onions to taste.</i>
<i n="7">Garlic – only use fresh garlic here for best flavor.</i>
<i n="8">Eggs – you can add <measurement>3</measurement> eggs here to stretch the recipe a bit. If it’s easier for you, you can stir in a bowl with a fork first then add to the skillet.</i>
<i n="9">Low-sodium soy sauce – if you have regular sodium soy sauce that will work too, just start with 2 Tbsp and add more if needed.</i>
